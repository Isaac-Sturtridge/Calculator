# Calculator
This will be a calculator with inbuilt simple functions to start with

The plan is for it to eventually be a full scientific calculator with all functionality to learn how to implement more complicated functions.

Currently (mostly) full implementation of four basic operations as well as square and square roots is implemented. Addition, subtraction and multiplication cannot yield floating point answers, and while the decimal point will be displayed, usage of those operations will round to integers. Pi is present on the calculator for display purposes but is not operational.

Initially I will just get it working.
